# Avie-Bird

### This is a personal web project called Avie Bird, it allows you to **customize a lovebird**!

## A short story about the proccess

<summary><b>First Sketches</b></summary>

At first this project was made to customize a character, **I did some sketches in Procreate and mockups in Photoshop**:

*(I even made it a bit responsive and the **item list dynamic**)*

Saddly, it didn't come to an end because it was too much to handle (hair, eyes, mouth, nose, clothes...) and I had a **deadline to fit in**.

   <summary><b>Javascript Prototype</b></summary>
    <br>
  
I decided to simplificate everything keeping the main idea of "customize something".  
I needed it to be smaller, less detailed but not less interesting, vibrant colors and maybe cuter, something like... **Jenaro***? 

And that's how this project changed from customizing a human to a lovebird.

*(New mockups perfected, I added what was inside the tabs and the colors container).*

This time I decided to focus on the functionality and left the design for the last point, so I did a prototype with vanilla Javascript, html and css:

   <summary><b>Moving to React and tiny prototype</b></summary>
    <br>
  
Next step was moving everything to React and the most difficult part was setting up the routes and links, I used **React Router Dom** and I works perfectly locally, but in production... there's some issues (They're desglosed in the [**version**](#version-10-addittions-issues-) section), it's not a bug that stops you from enjoying the experience of customizing a bird, but it can be problematic if you want to share the web.

For the items section, I had to do a prototype of the prototype, simplificate the project to the minimum to get results faster and know what I was doing. It's **ugly** but really **effective**.

 **This is Jenaro* â¤´

## VERSION 1.0 (addittions, issues,... )
- Item colors have been improved compared to the beta version.
- There's no translate button at this moment, but tabs are designed to not deformate if you use "translate this page" from google translate, for example.
- Firefox users may find issues with the visibility of the icons (arrows and paint buckets) I used the font Material Symbol from google and I still don't know if it's because firefox doesn't support it.
- When sharing the web, do it throught the link: "*dianastring.github.io/Avie-Bird*" not "*dianastring.github.io/Avie-Bird/body/base*. Also, refreshing the page returns a 404 error, this is a problem that's still under development. (If you have experience working with React Router DOM, dinamyc routes and know what's going on, please contact me <img alt="help" width="16"  src="https://images.emojiterra.com/google/noto-emoji/unicode-15.1/color/svg/1f972.svg">)
  
- Download and share images are not available at this moment. To be able to take a screenshot of the web, it has to be done with html2canvas but it doesn't support 'use xlinkHref' :'( (I'll try to find another way, maybe with rive app or just wait for a newer version of it)
